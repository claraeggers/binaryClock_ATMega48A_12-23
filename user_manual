SOFTWARE STRUCTURE


	#FUNCTIONS
	
	##void pwm_fkt(volatile uint8_t pwm, volatile bool sleep_mode_on)
	Function uses pwm volatile, that is incremented with Timer0 and boolean sleep_mode_on to get information, if sleep mode is enabled
	Function switches between LED on set to the right time and LED off to generate a software PWM for LED dimming
	LEDs are set off, wenn sleep_mode_on == true
	
	##void eeprom_write_byte(uint8_t *address, uint8_t value) 
	eeprom.h Functionality uses a reference to the address where to safe the data within the eeprom and the value to be written to the eeprom
	the function calls "update_byte" which reads the value before writing to it, to ensure longlivity#
	
	##void schlafen(volatile bool sleep_mode_on)
	Function uses boolean sleep_mode_on to switch to right mode
	When sleep_mode_on == true, function enables PWR_SAFE mode with additional PRR
	When sleep_mode_on == false, function disables sleep mode and enables some power-safes
	
	##void datum_safe(Datum datum){
	Function uses struct Datum, consisting of {Tag, Monat, Jahr, isSchalt}
	Function caluclates if current "Jahr" is a leap-year, if true it uses monate_schalt[]-array, if not it uses monate[]-array
	Function increases day, if day is higher than the number of the array[month], the day is set to one and the month is increased
	If Month is reaching 12 it is set to one and year is increased




	
	#ISR
	
	##TIMER2_OVF
	ISR fires, when after 255 clocks the clock is set again to 0, through Prescaler 128 this equals one second
	ISR has "ausgleich" which corrects seconds
	ISR decreases pause and prellS, pause intervenes with pwm-led showing to show date for 1 second, prellS debounces sleep-button
	
	##TIMER0_COMPA_vect
	ISR fires when compA is reached with timer 0, with no prescaler and 8MHZ internal osciallator pwm variable is increased rapidly
	Debounces other 3 buttons
	
	##INT0_vect
	ISR fires when button is pressed
